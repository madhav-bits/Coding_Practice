//******************************************************375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II.***************************************************

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

//This solution is the same as the above solution, except few included cases as described below.
//This solution contains the cases when the edge numbers(i,j) are chosen when subarray [i,j] under consideration.
//These cases were eliminated in *****Solution 1***** as they won't form the min. value which we are calc. once we exit from the innermost for loop.
