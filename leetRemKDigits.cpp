//********************************************************402. Remove K Digits.**************************************************

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

//Solution 1:
// The main essence is to remove those integers which are bigger than it's following integers, until the req. no. of deletions are done.
// If there are no num. bigger than its follo. elements/ If after implement. the above logic for the entire string& req. del aren't reached.
// then the delte elem. from the end, as the resulting string will be having non decreasing int., so greater valued int(i.e., from the end.)-
//- needs to be delted, resulting in the final result.
